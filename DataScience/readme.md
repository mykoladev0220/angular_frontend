# Coding Challenge
It is a Coding Challenge for the Data Science Field. You can use one of them.

## House prices
How can you find your dream house in America and which elements influence the house price?  

* Task (Medium): Analyse the data and find correlations. 
* Task (Medium): Feature engineering.
* Task (Challenging): predict house quality using proper variables.
* Task (Challenging): optimize the model.
* Task (Very Challenging): Use more features, maybe even add external data, for house quality prediction

## Job Prediction
How can you find a job using a given data?

* Task (Easy): Analyse the data and find correlations.
* Task (Medium): predict a job using proper variables.
* Task (Challenging): optimize the model.

### Explanation

* Analytical Ability.  
It deals with, if the candidate has enough analytical ability. Ex) Did the candidate understand the data correctly? Did the candidate process the data correctly? and for what reason did the candidate process the data? 

* Technical Background. 
It deals with, if the candidate has the technical ability that can solve the given problem. Ex) Did the candidate solve the problem without any error? Can the candidate understand the code that he/she wrote? 

* Theoretical Background. 
It deals with, if the candidate has the theoretical Background to support his/her opinion. Ex) Why did the candidate use the model? Why is this model better? Why is mean meaningful in this case than median?

* Solution. 
It represents the overall satisfaction of the solution submitted by the candidate. Ex) Is this solution suitable for this problem? is the reason of this solution convincing?

* Presentation. 
It represents the presentation ability of the candidate.
